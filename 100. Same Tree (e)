Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

class Solution:
  def isSameTree(self, p, q):
    if not p and not q: return True
    elif not p and q: return False
    elif not q and p: return False
    elif p.val != q.val: return False
    else: return self.isSameTree(p.left,q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right,q.right)
